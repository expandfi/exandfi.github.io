  ## Description
  At its core, ExpandFi helps Amazon Sellers expand their business off of Amazon. We do this in three ways: 1) We help our users understand the Lifetime Value (LTV) of their customers (this is incredibly important to know when you start marketing on Google/Facebook), 2) We help our users enrich the data of their Amazon customers by appeneding their email addresses, phone numbers, and demographics (Amazon does not provide any of this information to Third-Party Sellers), and 3) We help our users take their Amazon reviews and import them into Shopify and Google (this is a huge head start).
